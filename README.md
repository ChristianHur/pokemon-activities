# Pokemon Activities - Catch'em All
The main objective of this project is purely for entertainment. The project is composed of three different Google maps: Home, New Catch, Catch’em All. The Home map displays custom markers of all the Pokemons captured. The New Catch allows a user to upload their newest catch. The Catch’em All map allows the users to catch as many Pokemon on the map as they can. 

The Web technologies used in this project are mainly comprised of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Local Storage, and the Google maps API. This project is built heavily in JavaScript, JSON/AJAX APIs, and Google Maps.
